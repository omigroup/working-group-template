## Team Norms
_Team Norms are explicit agreements on how we’ll behave together and what we’ll do if an agreement is broken. It’s everyone’s responsibility to set and uphold these agreements, but it’s truly the Team Leader’s role to ensure the team lives by these norms._

## 1. Team Ground Rules 
How do we want to treat each other? (Try to keep the list to the most essential 3-5.)
Rule #1: 
Rule #2:
Rule #3:

_### Examples (delete all of this after)_
_Always assume everyone has the best intent_
_We conduct routine retrospectives to air out the good, the bad, and the improvable to avoid resentment, isolation, or conflict._
_Be on time!_  
_If you’re going to be late, post in the team discord channel to let the team know (be accountable)_

## 2. When we meet / Ceremonies 
Recurring meeting day and cadence: 
Demo days: 
Retrospective: 

_Examples remove any that don't fit your working group or that you do not want_ 

- Daily standup - discord check in 
- Sprint Review - have sprint review prep (last day of the sprint for 15 min)
sprint review/checklist will be created in Confluence
- **Sprint Retros - anonymous entries, but able to own it if you want be open, honest and respectful to your teammates**
- Sprint Planning - this should be capacity and velocity planning with PREVIOUSLY groomed stories from our backlog
- Grooming

## 3. Keeping Ourselves Accountable
Now that we have our norms, how will we hold ourselves accountable? What will we do if we see ourselves or someone else break a rule?
Method 1:
Method 2:

_Ideas: (delete after you decide on yours)_
_We chat in discord, but we track efforts on our github backlog_
_Discord bot to send a prompt to remind group members with omi-chan role of upcoming meetings_
_Simple Google form survey every 4 weeks to rate ourselves on a scale of 1 to 5, and suggest improvements (maybe instead of a actual proper retro, but I still recommend a retro)_ 
_We review our working agreement at every retro._ 


###### Note: The system should flex to your needs, not the other way around. Make sure you adopt processes that fit your needs and availability. There is nothing worse than resentment of process which leads to avoidance and eventually the entire effort fizzling out. We adopt these simple standards to make it easier for folks to get involved, and increase the chances of us finishing the the things we say we will do. Declaring yourself as blocked is not bad! It helps let the rest of the group know that they can help, etc.
